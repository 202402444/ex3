                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>Dior was born in Granville, a seaside town on the coast of Normandy, France. He was the second of five children born to Maurice Dior, a wealthy fertilizer manufacturer (the family firm was Dior Frères), and his wife, formerly Madeleine Martin. He had four siblings: Raymond (father of Françoise Dior), Jacqueline, Bernard, and Catherine Dior. When Christian was about five years old, the family moved to Paris.</p>
                    <p>Dior's family had hoped he would become a diplomat, but Dior was interested in art. To make money, he sold his fashion sketches outside his house for about 10 cents each ($2 in 2023 dollars). In 1928, he left school and received money from his father to finance a small art gallery, where he and a friend sold art by the likes of Pablo Picasso. The gallery closed three years later, following the deaths of Dior's mother and brother, as well as financial trouble during the Great Depression that resulted in his father losing control of the family business. Dior had no choice but to find another source of income to support himself.</p>

                <h2>The Dior Fashion House</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "It's such a new look!" - Carmel Snow, editor-in-chief of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In 1946, Marcel Boussac, a successful entrepreneur, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. In 1946, with Boussac's backing, Dior founded his fashion house. The name of the line of his first collection, presented on <time datetime="1947-02-12">12 February 1947</time>, was <del>Revolution</del> <ins>Corolle</ins> (literally the botanical term corolla or circlet of flower petals in English). Dior's debut collection included a launch of 90 garments displayed in outfits. The phrase <em>New Look</em> was coined for it by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>.</p>
                <p>Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the boxy, fabric-conserving shapes of the recent World War II styles that had been influenced by the wartime rationing of fabric. Despite being called "New," the Corolle line was clearly drawn from styles of the Edwardian era, refining and crystallizing trends in skirt shape and waistline that had been burgeoning in high fashion since the late 1930s. The house employed Pierre Cardin as head of its tailoring atelier for the first three years of its existence, and it was Cardin who designed one of the most popular of the Corolle ensembles, the 1947 Bar suit.</p>

                <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
                <p>Dior died of a sudden heart attack while on vacation in Montecatini, Italy, 24 October 1957 in the late afternoon while playing a game of cards. He was survived by Jacques Benita, a North African singer three decades his junior, the last of a number of discreet male lovers. Though Christian Dior passed away in 1957, his legacy continues to influence the world of fashion. The House of Dior has remained a symbol of elegance and innovation under the direction of subsequent creative directors.</p>
                <p>Throughout his illustrious career, Christian Dior received numerous awards and honors, recognizing his significant contributions to the fashion industry and his lasting impact on design. Below are some of the most notable accolades he achieved.</p>
